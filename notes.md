## Version Control - because save as is just won't cut it

## **Git Verbs - common actions developers use often**

### 1. *Forking and cloning*

        Forking - there's a copy out there and I can get a 100% replica
        Cloning - taking that copy and pulling it down to my local PC

### 2.Commit - sends the local copy to git

### 3. Pushing and pulling

        Push sends to server
        Pull gets from server

### 4.Branching - you can lock a particular version of the code and start a new one

        A copy of your own work

### 5.Merge, Rebase, and Squash

        Squash merge considers multiple banks as one bank

### 6. Pull request & Merge request
 
        tracked change merging

### 7. Stand and exercise

        Remember to move around
