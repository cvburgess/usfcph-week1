## Version Control (because save as is just won't cut it) 
## Git Verbs - common actions developers use often 
    1. Forking and cloning
        Forking - there's a copy out there and I can get a 100% replica
        Cloning - taking that copy and pulling it down to my local PC
    2.Commit - sends the local copy to git
    3. Pushing and pulling
        Push sends to server
        Pull gets from server
    4.Branching - you can lock a particular version of the code and start a new one
        A copy of your own work
    5.Merge, Rebase, and Squash
        Squash merge considers multiple banks as one bank
    6. Pull request & Merge request
        tracked change merging
    7. Stand and exercise
        Remember to move around
